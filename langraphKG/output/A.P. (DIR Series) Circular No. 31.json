{"name": "A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 31", "date_of_issue": "June 15, 2018", "summary": "The Reserve Bank of India has issued a circular to provide operational flexibility and transition path for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and custodians to adapt to the regulations on investment by FPIs in debt. The circular supersedes previous directions and defines short-term investments as those with residual maturity up to one year. It revises minimum residual maturity requirements for FPIs, defines related terms such as 'related FPIs', 'entities related to the corporate', and 'Multilateral Financial Institutions'. It also exempts certain securities from these definitions. The circular outlines revised investment limits and guidelines for FPIs in India, including a cap on aggregate FPI investments in Central Government securities, online monitoring of G-sec and SDL category investments, and requirements for short-term investments. It outlines concentration limits and investment requirements for FPIs in Government securities (G-secs), State Development Loans (SDLs), and corporate debt securities, as well as single/group investor-wise limits in corporate bonds. The circular also outlines changes to investment requirements for FPIs in corporate bonds and securities, effective immediately, including exemption of pipeline investments from certain requirements, withdrawal of previous exposure limits, and prohibition on investing in partly paid debt instruments. It states that the directions issued are under sections 10(4) and 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, without prejudice to permissions/approvals required under other laws.", "relations": {"A.P.
